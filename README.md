# OSDL-Space

![](/doc/osdl-space-title.png)

This repository corresponds to the part of the [OSDL project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/OSDL) gathering Erlang-based developments to manage spaces - mostly 3D ones.

It relies on:

- [Ceylan-Myriad](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad) for all base (Erlang) services related to linear computations, 3D processing and (OpenGL) rendering
- [Ceylan-WOOPER](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-WOOPER) to introduce higher-level, object-oriented abstractions such as scenes, cameras, etc.
- [Ceylan-Traces](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Traces) to benefit from rich and scalable (log-like) traces

Please refer to the [OSDL-Space official documentation](http://space.esperide.org), otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/OSDL-Space/).

The 'main' branch is aimed to correspond to the current stable version of this layer.
