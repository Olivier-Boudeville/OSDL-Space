% Description of the OSDL-Space OTP library application, typically used by
% rebar3.

% Note: if this file is named osdl_space.app, it is a *generated* file, whose
% real source is conf/osdl_space.app.src, from which
% _build/lib/osdl_space/ebin/osdl_space.app is obtained and copied to
% ebin/osdl_space.app; finally src/osdl_space.app.src is a mere symlink to this
% last file, so we have:
%
% ./conf/osdl_space.app.src [only real source]
% ./_build/lib/osdl_space/ebin/osdl_space.app
% ./ebin/osdl_space.app
% ./src/osdl_space.app.src -> ../ebin/osdl_space.app
%
% For more information see the Ceylan-Myriad 'rebar3-create-app-file' make
% target and its associated comments.
